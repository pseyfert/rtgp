# obvious things which need fixing

- [ ] check if sumw2 is set and enable error bars accordingly
  - [ ] access to draw options is there now, but parsing them with THistPainter requires accessing Hoption.Error
  - [ ] set error bars to 0 for histograms w/o errorbars when error bars are globally enabled
- [ ] go through line styles, marker styles, etc
- [ ] revisit usage of gnuplot-iostream interface (tempfile instead?)
